👋 Hello there! I'm [REDACTED], a [REDACTED]-year-old "cool thing" enthusiast with a *fervent* passion for mathematics, physics, decentralized finance (DeFi) and anything else amazing (Synthetic biology never ceases to amaze me...)

🚀 Currently, I'm engrossed in an exciting project over at [AequorCrypto](https://github.com/AequorCrypto)

🔍 I'm interested + involved with modelling economic systems and markets.

📚 "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show."

💻 Here are some technical things I can "boast" of

    Solidity contract engineering and DAPP development ⚙
    Gas optimization, as a hobbyist ⛽
    Web development 🕸
    Rust 🦀
    Plasmid design, once again as a hobbyist 🧪
    A lot more, such as game engine design, physics simulation experience and a robust understanding and application of mathematics to design and build many projects in the space of engineering 🔧
